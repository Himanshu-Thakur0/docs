## Question 3: UV-Visible Spectroscopy and Electronic Transitions

### Principle of UV-Visible Spectroscopy
UV-visible spectroscopy involves the absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the wavelength range 200-800 nm, causing electronic transitions in molecules.

**Beer-Lambert Law:** A = εcl
- A = Absorbance
- ε = Molar absorptivity
- c = Concentration
- l = Path length

### Types of Electronic Transitions

1. **σ → σ* Transitions:**
   - Highest energy transitions (λ < 200 nm)
   - Occur in saturated hydrocarbons
   - Require vacuum UV region
   - Example: Methane absorption at 125 nm

2. **n → σ* Transitions:**
   - Involve non-bonding electrons
   - Lower energy than σ → σ*
   - Found in compounds with heteroatoms (O, N, S)
   - Example: Water, alcohols, amines

3. **π → π* Transitions:**
   - Occur in unsaturated compounds
   - Conjugation shifts absorption to longer wavelengths
   - Most important for analytical applications
   - Example: Benzene (254 nm), β-carotene (450 nm)

4. **n → π* Transitions:**
   - Lowest energy transitions
   - Carbonyl compounds, nitro compounds
   - Often give weak absorption bands
   - Example: Acetone (280 nm)

### Significance and Examples

**Chromophores:** Functional groups responsible for color
- C=C, C=O, N=O, -N=N-, aromatic rings

   - In neutral/alkaline medium: O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O

**Complete Cell Reaction (Iron corrosion):**
- Anode: Fe → Fe²⁺ + 2e⁻
- Cathode: O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O
- Overall: 2Fe + O₂ + 4H⁺ → 2Fe²⁺ + 2H₂O

## Question 11: NMR Spectroscopy Principles

**Explain the principle of NMR spectroscopy. What is meant by term chemical shift? Explain how the NMR spectrum of a compound is recorded with example.**

### Solution:

#### Principle of NMR Spectroscopy:

**Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)** spectroscopy is based on the magnetic properties of certain atomic nuclei.

#### Basic Principles:

1. **Nuclear Spin:**
   - Nuclei with odd mass number or odd atomic number have nuclear spin
   - Common NMR-active nuclei: ¹H, ¹³C, ¹⁹F, ³¹P
   - Nuclear spin creates a magnetic moment

2. **Energy Levels in Magnetic Field:**
   - In external magnetic field, nuclei can exist in different energy states
   - For ¹H: two energy states (α and β)
   - Energy difference: ΔE = γℏB₀

3. **Resonance Condition:**
   - When radiofrequency matches energy difference, resonance occurs
   - ν = γB₀/2π (Larmor frequency)
   - γ = gyromagnetic ratio, B₀ = magnetic field strength

#### Chemical Shift:

**Definition:** Chemical shift is the difference in resonance frequency of a nucleus compared to a reference compound, expressed in parts per million (ppm).

**Formula:** δ = (ν_sample - ν_reference)/ν_spectrometer × 10⁶

**Reference Standard:** Tetramethylsilane (TMS) - (CH₃)₄Si
- Chemical shift of TMS = 0 ppm
- Inert, volatile, gives single sharp peak

**Factors Affecting Chemical Shift:**

1. **Electronegativity:**
   - More electronegative atoms cause downfield shift
   - Order: F > O > N > C > H

2. **Shielding and Deshielding:**
   - **Shielding:** Electron density around nucleus reduces effective magnetic field
   - **Deshielding:** Reduced electron density increases effective magnetic field

3. **Hybridization:**
   - sp³ < sp² < sp (increasing deshielding)

4. **Aromatic Effects:**
   - Aromatic protons highly deshielded (6-8 ppm)

#### Recording NMR Spectrum:

#### Instrumentation:

1. **Magnet:** Provides strong, uniform magnetic field (1-15 Tesla)
2. **Radiofrequency Generator:** Provides RF pulses
3. **Detector:** Records absorbed energy
4. **Computer:** Processes signals using Fourier Transform

#### Sample Preparation:
- Sample dissolved in deuterated solvent (CDCl₃, D₂O)
- TMS added as internal standard
- Sample placed in NMR tube

#### Recording Process:
1. Sample placed in magnetic field
2. RF pulse applied perpendicular to magnetic field
3. Nuclei absorb energy and flip to higher energy state
4. When RF pulse stops, nuclei relax back
5. Relaxation produces detectable signal (Free Induction Decay)
6. FT-NMR converts time domain to frequency domain

#### Example: NMR Spectrum of Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH)

**Expected Signals:**

1. **CH₃ group:** 
   - Chemical shift: ~1.2 ppm
   - Multiplicity: Triplet (coupled with CH₂)
   - Integration: 3H

2. **CH₂ group:**
   - Chemical shift: ~3.7 ppm
   - Multiplicity: Quartet (coupled with CH₃)
   - Integration: 2H

3. **OH group:**
   - Chemical shift: ~2.5 ppm (variable)
   - Multiplicity: Singlet (exchanges rapidly)
   - Integration: 1H

**Spectrum Interpretation:**
```
   OH(1H)          CH₂(2H)         CH₃(3H)
     |               |               |
     ▼               ▼               ▼
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
5.0    4.0     3.0     2.0     1.0     0.0 ppm
                                      TMS
```

**Coupling Patterns:**
- CH₃ appears as triplet due to coupling with CH₂ (n+1 rule: 2+1=3)
- CH₂ appears as quartet due to coupling with CH₃ (3+1=4)
- OH does not couple due to rapid exchange

#### Integration:
- Area under peaks proportional to number of protons
- Ratio of areas gives ratio of protons
- For ethanol: CH₃:CH₂:OH = 3:2:1

#### Applications:
1. Structure determination
2. Purity analysis
3. Quantitative analysis
4. Reaction monitoring
5. Conformational analysis

## Question 14: Crystal Field Stabilisation Energy (CFSE) and Pairing Energy (P) - Octahedral vs Tetrahedral Ligand Fields

### Crystal Field Stabilisation Energy (CFSE)
CFSE is the stabilization energy that results from the splitting of d-orbitals in the presence of ligands. It represents the difference in energy between the d-electrons in a ligand field and those in a spherically symmetric field.

**Formula for CFSE:**
- Octahedral: CFSE = (number of electrons in t₂g × -0.4Δₒ) + (number of electrons in eg × +0.6Δₒ) + (P × number of electron pairs)
- Tetrahedral: CFSE = (number of electrons in e × -0.6Δₜ) + (number of electrons in t₂ × +0.4Δₜ) + (P × number of electron pairs)

### Pairing Energy (P)
Pairing energy is the energy required to pair two electrons in the same orbital. It includes:
- Electrostatic repulsion between electrons
- Exchange energy loss when electrons are paired

### Octahedral Ligand Field Splitting

```

    eg ↑     ↑     (dx²-y², dz²)
         +0.6Δₒ
    ─────────────── Average energy level
         -0.4Δₒ
    t₂g ↑  ↑  ↑    (dxy, dxz, dyz)
```

**Characteristics of Octahedral Splitting:**
- Energy gap = Δₒ (crystal field splitting energy)
- Lower energy orbitals: t₂g (3 orbitals)
- Higher energy orbitals: eg (2 orbitals)
- Splitting ratio: 3:2 (energy difference)

### Tetrahedral Ligand Field Splitting

```
Energy Level Diagram for Tetrahedral Complex:

    t₂  ↑  ↑  ↑    (dxy, dxz, dyz)
         +0.4Δₜ
    ─────────────── Average energy level
         -0.6Δₜ
    e   ↑     ↑     (dx²-y², dz²)
```

**Characteristics of Tetrahedral Splitting:**
- Energy gap = Δₜ (crystal field splitting energy)
- Lower energy orbitals: e (2 orbitals)
- Higher energy orbitals: t₂ (3 orbitals)
- Relationship: Δₜ = (4/9)Δₒ

### Comparison Table: Octahedral vs Tetrahedral

| Feature | Octahedral | Tetrahedral |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Number of ligands** | 6 | 4 |
| **Lower energy orbitals** | t₂g (3 orbitals) | e (2 orbitals) |
| **Higher energy orbitals** | eg (2 orbitals) | t₂ (3 orbitals) |
| **Energy splitting** | Δₒ | Δₜ = (4/9)Δₒ |
| **Stabilization factor** | -0.4Δₒ, +0.6Δₒ | -0.6Δₜ, +0.4Δₜ |
| **Common examples** | [Fe(CN)₆]³⁻, [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺ | [FeCl₄]⁻, [CoCl₄]²⁻ |

## Question 15: Strong and Weak Ligand Fields in Crystal Field Theory - Octahedral Complexes

### Crystal Field Theory - Historical Background
**Proposed by:** Hans Bethe (1929) and later developed by John Hasbrouck van Vleck

Crystal Field Theory (CFT) was developed to explain the bonding, magnetic properties, and colors of transition metal complexes by treating the metal-ligand interaction as purely electrostatic.

### Basic Postulates of Crystal Field Theory

1. **Electrostatic Interaction**: Metal-ligand bonding is purely ionic/electrostatic
2. **Point Charge Model**: Ligands are treated as point charges or point dipoles
3. **d-Orbital Splitting**: Ligand field splits degenerate d-orbitals into different energy levels
4. **No Orbital Overlap**: No covalent bonding or orbital mixing is considered
5. **Crystal Field Stabilization**: Electrons occupy lower energy orbitals preferentially

### Strong Field vs Weak Field Ligands

#### Strong Field Ligands (Low Spin)
**Characteristics:**
- Cause large crystal field splitting (Large Δₒ)
- Pairing energy (P) < Δₒ
- Electrons pair in lower energy orbitals before occupying higher ones
- Result in low-spin complexes
- Usually diamagnetic or have fewer unpaired electrons

**Examples:** CN⁻, CO, NO₂⁻, en (ethylenediamine), NH₃, py (pyridine)

**Spectrochemical Series Position:** Right side (high Δₒ values)

#### Weak Field Ligands (High Spin)
**Characteristics:**
- Cause small crystal field splitting (Small Δₒ)
- Pairing energy (P) > Δₒ
- Electrons occupy all d-orbitals singly before pairing
- Result in high-spin complexes
- Usually paramagnetic with maximum unpaired electrons

**Examples:** I⁻, Br⁻, Cl⁻, F⁻, OH⁻, H₂O, SCN⁻

**Spectrochemical Series Position:** Left side (low Δₒ values)

### Electronic Configuration Examples

#### d⁵ Configuration (e.g., Fe³⁺, Mn²⁺)

**Weak Field (High Spin):**
```
eg:  ↑     ↑     
t₂g: ↑  ↑  ↑     
```
- 5 unpaired electrons
- Magnetic moment = √[n(n+2)] = √35 = 5.92 BM

**Strong Field (Low Spin):**
```
eg:  -     -     
t₂g: ↑↓ ↑  ↑     
```
- 1 unpaired electron
- Magnetic moment = √3 = 1.73 BM

#### d⁶ Configuration (e.g., Fe²⁺, Co³⁺)

**Weak Field (High Spin):**
```
eg:  ↑     ↑     
t₂g: ↑↓ ↑  ↑     
```
- 4 unpaired electrons
- Magnetic moment = √24 = 4.90 BM

**Strong Field (Low Spin):**
```
eg:  -     -     
t₂g: ↑↓ ↑↓ ↑↓    
```
- 0 unpaired electrons (diamagnetic)
- Magnetic moment = 0 BM

### Factors Affecting Ligand Field Strength

1. **Nature of metal ion**: Higher oxidation state → stronger field
2. **Size of metal ion**: Smaller ion → stronger field
3. **Electronic configuration**: d⁴⁻d⁷ show both high and low spin
4. **Ligand electronegativity**: Higher electronegativity → stronger field
5. **π-bonding capability**: π-acceptor ligands → stronger field

### Applications of CFT

4. **Geometry preference prediction**
5. **Jahn-Teller distortion explanation**

## Question 16: Corrosion Explanations

### a) Why Impure Metals Corrode Faster than Pure Metals

**Mechanism:**
Impure metals corrode faster due to the formation of **galvanic cells** at the microscopic level.

**Detailed Explanation:**

1. **Galvanic Cell Formation:**
   - Impurities act as cathodes
   - Pure metal acts as anode
   - Different metals have different electrode potentials

2. **Electrochemical Process:**
   ```
   At Anode (Pure metal): M → M²⁺ + 2e⁻
   At Cathode (Impurity): O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O
   ```

3. **Examples:**
   - Iron with copper impurities
   - Zinc with iron impurities
   - Aluminum with copper traces

**Factors Contributing:**
- Different electrode potentials create potential difference
- Microscopic galvanic cells accelerate corrosion
- Heterogeneous surface promotes localized corrosion
- Impurities may catalyze corrosion reactions

### b) Why Corrosion is More Rapid if Cathode Area is Larger than Anode

**Principle:**
According to **Faraday's laws** and **current density relationships**, corrosion rate is inversely proportional to anode area and directly proportional to total current.

**Mathematical Relationship:**
```
Corrosion Rate ∝ Current Density at Anode
Current Density = Total Current / Anode Area
```

**Detailed Mechanism:**

1. **Current Distribution:**
   - Total corrosion current remains constant
   - Large cathode area → more sites for reduction reactions
   - Small anode area → high current density

2. **Electrochemical Reactions:**
   ```
   At Anode: Fe → Fe²⁺ + 2e⁻ (concentrated on small area)
   At Cathode: O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O (distributed over large area)
   ```

3. **Consequences:**
   - Rapid metal dissolution at anode
   - Pitting corrosion
   - Accelerated localized attack

**Practical Examples:**
- Riveted joints (small anode, large cathode)
- Dissimilar metal connections
- Crevice corrosion scenarios

### c) Dry Corrosion with Example

**Definition:**
Dry corrosion is the direct chemical reaction between metal and atmospheric gases (mainly oxygen) in the absence of moisture.

**Mechanism:**
Direct oxidation of metal surface by atmospheric oxygen:
```
2M + nO₂ → 2MₓOᵧ
```

**Detailed Process:**

1. **Initial Reaction:**
   ```
   4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃
   ```

2. **Film Formation:**
   - Oxide layer forms on surface
   - May be protective or non-protective

3. **Rate Determining Factors:**
   - Temperature
   - Oxygen partial pressure
   - Nature of oxide film

**Types of Oxide Films:**

**Protective Films:**
- Characteristics: Dense, adherent, non-porous
- Examples: Al₂O₃ on aluminum, Cr₂O₃ on chromium
- Result: Self-limiting corrosion

**Non-Protective Films:**
- Characteristics: Porous, non-adherent, volatile
- Examples: Fe₂O₃ on iron
- Result: Continuous corrosion

**Example - Oxidation of Iron:**
```
Stage 1: 2Fe + O₂ → 2FeO (close to metal surface)
Stage 2: 6FeO + O₂ → 2Fe₃O₄ (intermediate layer)
Stage 3: 4Fe₃O₄ + O₂ → 6Fe₂O₃ (outer layer)
```

**Factors Affecting Dry Corrosion:**
1. Temperature
2. Oxygen concentration

## Question 18: Knocking in Internal Combustion Engines and Coal Analysis Calculation

### Knocking in Internal Combustion Engines

**Definition:**
Knocking is an abnormal combustion phenomenon in internal combustion engines characterized by metallic pinging sounds, caused by auto-ignition of the fuel-air mixture before the flame front reaches it.

### Mechanism of Knocking

**Normal Combustion:**
1. Spark ignition at spark plug
2. Flame front propagates smoothly through mixture
3. Pressure rises gradually
4. Complete combustion before exhaust valve opens

**Knocking Combustion:**
1. Spark ignition occurs normally
2. Unburned mixture ahead of flame front gets compressed and heated
3. Auto-ignition occurs before flame front arrival
4. Multiple flame fronts collide, creating pressure waves
5. Rapid pressure oscillations cause knocking sound

**Chemical Mechanism:**
1. **Pre-ignition reactions:** Formation of peroxides and aldehydes
2. **Chain branching:** Radical multiplication reactions
3. **Critical conditions:** High temperature and pressure trigger auto-ignition
4. **Detonation:** Supersonic combustion wave formation

**Factors Promoting Knocking:**
- High compression ratio
- High intake temperature
- Advanced ignition timing
- Low octane number fuel
- Carbon deposits in combustion chamber
- Lean fuel-air mixture

**Prevention Methods:**
- Use high octane fuels
- Retard ignition timing
- Reduce compression ratio
- Add anti-knock compounds (TEL, MTBE)
- Optimize fuel injection timing

### Coal Analysis Calculation

**Given Data:**
- Initial weight of coal sample = 2.5 g
- Weight after heating at 110°C for 1 h = 2.32 g
- Weight after heating at 950°C for 7 min = 1.55 g
- Final constant weight = 0.30 g

**Calculations:**

**1. Moisture Content:**
Moisture = (Initial weight - Weight after 110°C) / Initial weight × 100
Moisture = (2.5 - 2.32) / 2.5 × 100 = 0.18 / 2.5 × 100 = **7.2%**

**2. Volatile Matter:**
Calculated on moisture-free basis:
Moisture-free sample weight = 2.32 g
Weight after volatile matter removal = 1.55 g
Volatile matter = (2.32 - 1.55) / 2.32 × 100 = 0.77 / 2.32 × 100 = **33.19%**

Converting to original sample basis:
Volatile matter = 33.19 × (2.32/2.5) = **30.84%**

**3. Ash Content:**
Ash = Final weight / Initial weight × 100
Ash = 0.30 / 2.5 × 100 = **12.0%**

**4. Fixed Carbon:**
Fixed Carbon = 100 - (Moisture + Volatile Matter + Ash)
Fixed Carbon = 100 - (7.2 + 30.84 + 12.0) = **49.96%**

**Proximate Analysis Results:**
- Moisture: 7.2%
- Volatile Matter: 30.84%
- Ash: 12.0%
- Fixed Carbon: 49.96%

**Coal Quality Assessment:**
- Moderate moisture content (acceptable for most uses)
- High volatile matter (suitable for combustion applications)
- Moderate ash content (may require ash handling systems)
- Good fixed carbon content (indicates decent calorific value)

This coal appears suitable for general combustion applications but may not be ideal for metallurgical coking due to high volatile matter content.
